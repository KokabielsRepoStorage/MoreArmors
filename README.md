# MoreArmors
This mod creates some of the stuff in 1.16, but not all, adds some good and stupid armors and weapons.

Please let people know that you edited mine if you do



All of the textures require jsonfiles, and a lang file. The files will be worked on as I go.


(Note My workspace is throwing a fit and now it will be directly developed on github)
